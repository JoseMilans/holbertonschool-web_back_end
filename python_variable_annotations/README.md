# Python Variable Annotations Project

In this directory I explore the use of variable annotations in Python. Variable annotations provide a way to specify the expected data types of variables, enhancing code readability and allowing for better static analysis. The focus of these exercises is to practice and understand how to use type annotations in Python functions and learn their benefits in writing clear and maintainable code.

The project includes various Python scripts, each demonstrating different aspects and uses of type annotations in Python 3.9.

Through these exercises, I delve into the practical applications of type annotations in everyday coding, emphasising their importance in creating robust and error-resistant programs.
