# ES6 Basics Project

In this repository I'm learning about ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a significant update to JavaScript that introduces new syntax and features. This project focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 concepts such as `const`, `let`, arrow functions, template literals, and more. The tasks are designed to provide practical experience with ES6's improvements over previous versions, enhancing the efficiency and clarity of my JavaScript code.
