# ES6 Data Manipulation Project

In this repository I'm focusing on ES6 and its data manipulation capabilities.

Through this project I'll apply the concepts for data danipulation. Notably, new data structures such as maps and sets.

*Key concepts as follows:*
**Array methods:** map, filter, and reduce
- map: Transforms each element of an array.
- filter: Selects elements based on a condition.
- reduce: Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function.
**Typed Arrays:** Arrays where each element is of the same data type. Useful for performance optimisation.
**Set Data Structure:** A collection of unique values. Similar to sets in Python.
**Map Data Structure:** Key-value pairs, like dictionaries in Python.
**WeakMap:** Similar to map, but with keys that are weakly referenced, allowing for garbage collection.
