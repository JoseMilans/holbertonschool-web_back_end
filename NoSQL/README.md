# NoSQL Project

In this repository I'm working with NoSQL databases, particularly focusing on MongoDB. The project includes various tasks and scripts designed to interact with MongoDB, demonstrating operations such as listing databases, querying data, and more. This project is part of my learning journey in understanding the intricacies of NoSQL databases and how they differ from traditional SQL databases.
