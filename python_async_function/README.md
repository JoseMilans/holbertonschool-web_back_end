# Asynchronous Functions in Python

In this repository I'm learning about asynchronous functions in Python, focusing on the use of `async` and `await` syntax and how to effectively implement async programming patterns. The project involves understanding and applying concepts like asyncio tasks, running concurrent coroutines and utilising the random module in asynchronous contexts.
Asynchronous programming in Python is especially useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.
