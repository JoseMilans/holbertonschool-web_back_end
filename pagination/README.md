# Pagination Project

In this repository I'm exploring the concept of pagination in Python. This project involves implementing various pagination techniques, understanding how to handle large datasets efficiently, and learning how to present data in a user-friendly manner. The project covers basic pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-resilient pagination methods.
